This tool creates a 3d package as a zip file without any external dependencies. The package can be hosted on webspace and platforms like wordpress or moodle. All needed sources are bundled for working as a standalone 3d ressource. 

---

## How to

- __[Start the tool âœ¨](https://trmsc.github.io/3d-package-creator/)__ and load 3d models as glb-files or as glTF-folders.   
- You can check the preview and download your independent 3d package for e.g. webspace, wordpress, moodle.  
- Start the index.html within your hosted package. ðŸš€  

In __moodle__ you can drag and drop the zip file - extract it and set the index.html as the main file.

## Model ressources

> [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) - library for 3d models - select the glTF format for using within the 3d package creator

> [three.js-editor](https://threejs.org/editor/) - online editor for 3d modeling with a lot of import and export possibilities

> Use images as 3d models by choosing an online image to glb converter

> [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - free and comprehensive software for creating, editing and converting 3d models

## Roadmap
